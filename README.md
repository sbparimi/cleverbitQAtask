# Some useful information to understand the test cases:
1. I have created these test cases using BDD approach in Gherkin syntax 
2. The idea is to reuse them in the automation as executable specifications, if require 
3. The test data is mentioned in the Example table, wherever applicable in the scenarios 
4. I limited the currencies to only Bit coin in the crypto currencies space 
5. I considered obsolate and replaced currencies as well ( For example, LUF is replaced with EUR) 
6. semicolon(;) is legal query string paramter when accessing the page URL
